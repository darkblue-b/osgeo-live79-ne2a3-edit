==============================

TODO - better README
--------------------

This project is a complete editor for a substantial dataset,
using every international character set. The web interface
provides a fast and efficient way to edit something that 
otherwise could be difficult, while preserving the utf-8
characters at all stages.

There are three parts:  SQL, WSGI and HTML

WSGI
-------------

You will need to configure your favorite web server with
the wsgi extensions shown.


SQL
-------------
The data is currently under revision. Included are the 
schema definitions, using a postgres database role
*ne2a3_editor*

HTML
-------------
This kit is built on Dojo Toolkit 1.7.
The include path at the top of each page must be 
adjusted for your setup. Currently, in the main
web server directory, there are two dirs.. 
*dojo17* an alias to an svn checkout of Dojo 1.7
*osgeo_live79* directory of web assets

*Important*
Each of 40+ fields have a regular expression 
in the HTML page that validates the field.
These regExs are under development, and
are a major reason for the whole endeavor.
