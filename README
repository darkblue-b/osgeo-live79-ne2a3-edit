natural_earth_live79_alpha_dojo
==============================

TODO - better README
--------------------

The goal is to carefully compare and contrast the original
admin1 dataset, with a new, expanded admin1 version for
Natural Earth2.

This git project is a complete admin1 dataset editor,
using every international character set. The web interface
provides a fast and efficient way to edit something that 
otherwise could be difficult, while preserving the utf-8
characters at all stages.

There are three parts:  WSGI, SQL, HTML


WSGI
-------------

You will need to configure your favorite web server with
the wsgi extensions shown.


SQL
-------------

Included here are the schema definitions, currently using a  
postgres database role *ne2a3_editor* as owner, and a read-only
role *ne2_edit"  

There is an implicit three part heirarchy, defined
in the SQL. The original admin1 table is present also.

*MASTER* the new admin1 as checked out from the natural_earth repository
*jan14_web* is MASTER minus the geometry, and a convenient pkey
*jan14_edit* is the repository of all edit activity.

As noted in the opening page, all edits are stored seperately
and can be reviewed individually for addition to the
main set. The edit mechanism adds a timestamp and
IP address for each edit.


HTML
-------------
This kit is built on Dojo Toolkit 1.7.
The include path at the top of each page must be 
adjusted for your setup. Currently, in the main
web server directory, there are two dirs.. 
*dojo17* an alias to an svn checkout of Dojo 1.7
*osgeo_live79* directory of web assets

*Important*
Each of 40+ fields have a regular expression 
in the HTML page that validates the field.
These regExs are under development, and
are a major reason for the whole endeavor.
